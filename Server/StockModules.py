# NOTE: Response object is a wrapper for the response data that is sent to the client
# It contains the status code of the response, the message and the actual data
# The status code is used to determine if the request was successful or not
# based on situation specific criteria this can be anything you want
# and the method using a response object should clearly indicate what each status code means
# for example: 0 = success, 1 = error etc.
# NOTE: Be careful when refactoring status codes, as the client and the server
# have to both match the status code logic to work properly
#
# INFO: You can use enums to make this more readable
# enum StatusCode { Success = 0, Error = 1, Unauthorized = 2, Unknown = 3, } etc...
